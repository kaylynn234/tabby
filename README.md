# Tabby

A home-grown, non-GMO Discord bot. Tabby is a slimmed-down alternative to Mee6, aimed at smaller communities who are
looking for a Discord bot that "just works" and stays out of their way.

## Features

- Members can chat to gain XP and level up. Tabby uses the same XP curve as Mee6, and supports importing a server's
  existing Mee6 XP via the Mee6 API
- Server leaderboards and profile cards
- Automatically assign roles to members when they join your server or level up
- It's cute!
- It looks really good on my résumé

## Development status

Tabby is now mostly feature-complete, but a lot of documentation still needs to happen. This readme will be somewhat
bare until then. Sit tight!
